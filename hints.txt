The basic Idea is:

- Divide the process (the service process) into 3 layers:
    1. API - mothods remote application can call
    2. BBL - Business logic layer, where processing is done
    3. DAL - Data access layer - the methods through you can access the data 

In order to provide a scalability pattern of the process (the service process), 
I've defined an interface for the API layer and anotherone for the DAL. 
In this way the remote application will call the API methodsas it ever used to 
do. Further has been made a DAL interface, that allows the developer to manage 
different ways to access the data (in this development the data are all stored 
in a DB). Indeed, providing the same methods (defined within the DAL interface),
 the BLL can access the data beside which is the data management system in use.
